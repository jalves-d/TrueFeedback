# TrueFeedback

This project is being developed to optimize processes for the quality department of a contact center company, the code published will not be the final version of the project, but the prototype.

Some of the features:

- Different Access Levels.
- Registration of Feedbacks and Monitoring made by the evaluators.
- Daily log of data collected from the call system made by the administrator.
- Consultation and Management of Feedback and Monitoring.

Some of the features still to be implemented :

- Monitoring the performance and evolution of agents, evaluators, and teams.
- Encryption of user passwords.
- Agent tracking page.
- Issuance of reports generated from the data collected by the call system.

I decided to develop this project due to my need to see applications of my learning in real world problems, if the application can be used in the future by the company, some changes will be made to the project.

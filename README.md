# TrueFeedback

This project is developed to optimize processes for the quality department of a contact center company, the code published is just a prototype.

Some of the features:

- Different Access Levels.
- Registration of Feedbacks and Monitoring made by the evaluators.
- Daily log of data collected from the call system made by the administrator.
- Consultation and Management of Feedback and Monitoring.

Some of the features still to be implemented, probably will not be :

- Monitoring the performance and evolution of agents, evaluators, and teams.
- Encryption of user passwords.
- Agent tracking page.
- Issuance of reports generated from the data collected by the call system.

I decided to develop this project due to my need to see applications of my learning in real world problems.
